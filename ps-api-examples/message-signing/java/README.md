# Java Payment Services message signing example

This is a sample Java program showing how to use your Payments API key to sign requests to the Starling Payment Services APIs.

## Request Signing Sample Code

This project provides sample Java code to generate valid signatures for authorising requests to the Starling Bank payment APIs. You can execute the code by running the `Mainline` class, uncommenting respective lines according to the numbered instructions.

The sample shows you how to:
- generate a key pair to upload to the portal
- validate the uploaded key by reading payment business information
- create an account to hold funds for instructing payments
- create an address for the account to send payments from
- send an outbound payment from the address
