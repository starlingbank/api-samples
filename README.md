# ðŸ“– Starling Bank API samples

This repository contains code samples to make it easy to integrate with the Starling APIs. We can't wait to see what cool stuff you'll make!

You can find examples for our Public API endpoints and our Payment Services API endpoints.

For more information, see our [Public API documentation](https://developer.starlingbank.com/docs) or our [Payment Services API documentation](https://developer.starlingbank.com/payments/docs).

As with everything we do at Starling, we'd love to learn how we can make stuff better. If you have feedback, contact us on the [Starling Developer Slack](https://developer.starlingbank.com/community).
