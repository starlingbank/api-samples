# Starling key rotation samples

These samples show you how to use your rotation key to rotate your API keys.

These samples are common to both our Public APIs and our Payment Service APIs.

You can read more about rotating keys in our [Public API documentation](https://developer.starlingbank.com/docs) and our [Payment Service API documentation](https://developer.starlingbank.com/payments/docs).
